## About

I am a Software Engineer @ Google AI.
My current work focuses on Computer Vision, mainly on instance-level recognition/retrieval.
I graduated with a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2016, working on image and video retrieval, under the supervision of [Prof. Bernd Girod](http://www.stanford.edu/~bgirod).
During my time at Stanford, I also worked on image classification and compression.
I am a [Fulbright Science & Technology Scholar](http://fulbrightscienceandtech.org/) and an [Accel Innovation Scholar](http://stvp.stanford.edu/ais/).
On the science outreach side, I co-founded and was an editor of [The Global Scientist](https://theglobalscientist.com/) online magazine.
