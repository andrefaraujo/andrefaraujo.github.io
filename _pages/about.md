## About

I am a Staff Software Engineer / Tech Lead Manager @ Google Research.
My current work focuses on computer vision, mainly on instance-level recognition/retrieval.
I graduated with a Ph.D. from Stanford University in 2016, under the supervision of [Prof. Bernd Girod](http://www.stanford.edu/~bgirod).
I was also a [Fulbright Science & Technology Scholar](http://fulbrightscienceandtech.org/) and an [Accel Innovation Scholar](http://stvp.stanford.edu/ais/).
